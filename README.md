# Driven Retail Revolution: Unveiling Customer Insights for MEKKO Retail Inc. Using Excel

MEKKO Retail Inc. is a rapidly growing retail chain with multiple departments catering to a diverse customer base. With 1000 customers and an average age of 37, MEKKO faces the challenge of maintaining a comprehensive overview of customer demographics, preferences, and purchasing behavior.

As MEKKO Retail Inc. expands, it's crucial to extract actionable insights from the vast amount of customer data available. The company aims to enhance sales, improve customer satisfaction, and deliver personalized experiences. Utilizing advanced data analytics, I analyzed MEKKO Retail Inc.'s customer data and uncovered several key insights which include:

The majority of customers identify as male or female.

The most popular cars among customers are Ford and Toyota, constituting 48% and 46% of the total customer distribution, respectively.

The Young Adult age group comprises the largest segment of customers and mainly patronizes the Electronics, Jewelry, and Sports Departments.

The top five departments based on customer numbers are jewelry, games, electronics, clothing, and music.

The clothing department is less frequented by customers with more sophisticated job titles.

Based on these insights, I formulated the following recommendations to improve MEKKO Retail Inc.'s business strategy:

Implement targeted marketing campaigns tailored to the preferences of male and female customers, focusing on the Young Adult age group.

Promote popular products like Ford and Toyota cars and stock them prominently within the store.

Personalize the shopping experience for Young Adult customers by offering tailored recommendations and special offers in the Electronics, Jewelry, and Sports Departments.

Allocate more resources to stock popular products and ensure that the clothing department is stocked with trendy and fashionable items.

Train employees in the clothing department to provide excellent customer service and allocate more staff to departments with higher customer traffic.

By implementing these recommendations, MEKKO Retail Inc. aims to enhance customer satisfaction, boost sales, and maintain its position as a leading retail chain in the market.
